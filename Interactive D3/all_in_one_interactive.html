		<h5>Data Analysis Results</h5>
		<p class="inset">
        <li>Overall the lack of healthcare rate seems positively correlated with poverty rate by state</li>
        <li>New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate but a medium lack of healthcare rate</li>
        <li>Massachusetts has the lowest lack of healthcare rate but a medium poverty rate</li>
        <li>Texas has the highest lack of healthcare rate but a medium poverty rate</li>
        <li>Mississippi has the highest poverty rate and relatively high lack of healthcare rate as well</li>

			<h5>Correlations Discovered Between  Age, Income, Poverty Level Rate & Health Risks</h5>
          <p class ="groove" >
		  <b>Analysis 1:</b> Percentage of population In Poverty.   Overall, a general trend can be seen that with the increase 
            of poverty percentage within a US state, there is an increase in all health concerns.  Additional observation 
            reveals a trend of higher poverty percentages in Southeastern States, along with higher incidences of percentages 
            of all three comparisons provided.
			</br>

          <b>Analysis 2:</b> Age (Median).  A look into the age comparisons gives insights into particular US States more-so than 
            an overall trend.  An example is WV has a higher age median, better healthcare, but unexpected higher percentages 
            of obesity ad smokers.  Also of note are Northeastern States as having a higher age median and better healthcare.
			</br>

          <b>Analysis 3:</b> Household Income( Median). There is clearly a relationship between household income  and the occurrence 
            of obesity and smoking.  The higher the income the less likeliness of these two measures of health risks. Analyzing 
            Household Income against Lacks Healthcare, there is a noticeable increase of risk with lesser incomes.  Again, the 
            Southeastern States rank poorer than other states for healthcare, and the Northeastern states are faring better.  
            Two individual sates are on the extremes; TX and MA would be worth looking into for reasons as to why TX has such a 
            high percentage of population lacking healthcare, and why MA is very low.
			</br>
		  <b>Analysis 4:</b>Health insurance coverage.There seems higher in states with a lower average income. This is counter intuitive but may
           be a result of medicaid availability.Age doesn't seem to be a factor in Health Insurance Coverage.
		   </br>
		   
		   <b>Analysis 5:</b>Obesity %. There is a visible trend that suggests that the poorer states tend to have higher incidences of obesity. 
		   Mississippi ranks the highest in terms of obesity and poverty, 
            while states such as Hawaii enjoy economic prosperity and a fitter population. 
            However, the trend is not absolute, there are some clear outliers. For example, there are states such as North Dakota with relatively 
			low poverty and high obesity rates.
